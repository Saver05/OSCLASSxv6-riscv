## What I did
    # riscv.h
        - Added PTE_A flag
    # syscall.c
        - added pgaccess to syscalls array
    # syscall.h
        - Added syscall number for pgaccess
    # sysproc.c
        - added sys_pgaccess
    # vm.c
        - created the vmprint and pgaccess function
    # test_pgaccess.c
        - tests the vmprint and pgaccess functions should return every even page
            is access and every odd is not
    # user.h
        - added pgaccess syscall
    # usys.pl
        - added pgaccess
