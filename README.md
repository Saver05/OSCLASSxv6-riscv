## What I did
    # getpinfo.c
        - New file to get the process info of the currently running processes, including tickets
    # hardwork.c
        - Check given to us to see if our scheduler worked
    # Makefile
        - Added new files to be compiled
    # proc.c
        - Added a new function called getpinfo to get the tickets, pid and whether a program is inuse
        - Redid the scheduler to make it randomly ticket based
    # main.c
        - Initialized random
    # proc.h
        - Added new function to the header file
    # syscall.c
        - Added new syscall getpinfo
    # sysproc.c
        - Added two new syscalls settickets and getpinfo
    # user.h
        - Included pstat in the user header
